## Info
#### What exactly it does?
The script (yaa) helps you to get malware samples from MalwareBazaar. Even you can download all the samples directly by requesting the API, however, with a permanent script it's easy somehow. Sometimes, you don't even want the sample but the SHA-256 hash (quite a popular hashing algorithm in the malware area), so this script also helps you too.
